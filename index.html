      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch, optional</li>
        <li>1 ¬º cups (140g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>
          1/3 cup (80ml) cold heavy cream, <i>not plain whipping cream</i>
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) coarsely chopped pecans, for topping cake</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Instructions">
      <h2 id="Instructions">Instructions üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to <b>350¬∞F (176¬∞C)</b>.</li>
        <li>
          Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom with parchment
          paper, and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and
          sides of both pans.
        </li>

        <li>
          Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until
          very well blended.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and
          vanilla.
        </li>

        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.</li>

        <li>
          Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the
          bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring
          until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
        </li>

        <li>Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>

        <li>Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.</li>

        <li>
          Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and
          when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean,
          35 to 45 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cool the cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the
          cake layers out onto cooling racks. Remove the parchment paper and
          cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the
          bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to
          do its thing.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium
          speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute.
        </li>

        <li>
          Beat in the powdered sugar and cornstarch. I like sifting the powdered
          sugar and cornstarch over the cream cheese to remove lumps. If you do
          not have a fine mesh sieve, beat in the cornstarch and powdered sugar
          a 1/4 cup at a time until combined.
        </li>

        <li>
          Pour in the heavy cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes or
          until the frosting is whipped and creamy. This frosting resembles the
          texture of whipped cream. Chill covered until ready to frost the cake.
        </li>

        <li>
          When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake
          layer and place the second cake layer on top.
        </li>

        <li>
          Add the remaining frosting to the top of the carrot cake and use a
          butter knife or small spatula to swirl the frosting around. Leave the
          sides of the cake unfrosted. Finish with a handful of nuts on top.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Traditional Cream Cheese Frosting :</h2>
    <p>
      In a large bowl, beat 16 ounces of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of softened
      butter together for a minute or two until smooth. Add 4 ¬Ω cups of powdered
      sugar, 1 ¬º teaspoons of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat for 2
      to 3 minutes until extra creamy. If it is too thick, add 1 tablespoon of
      cream or milk.
